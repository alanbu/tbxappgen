Format of index file

<Skeletons> outer tag for whole file
<Skeleton> individual skeleton information.
   Text inside this tag it the full description shown in the app info window.
   Attributes:
     ID  subdirectory in "Files" directory that contains the files for the skeleton.
     Name name shown in drop down list on dialog box
     MakeFile - use this to use the standard makefile.
     FileType [="ReadOnly"] used on its own the attribute means include full information for a filetype. The Readonly setting means the filetype is used, but not owned by the application. i.e. sprites and system variables are not set up.


The source files (in cc or h directory), the Makefile and the help file have the following text substitutions.

%APPNAME% - application name
%APPNAME_LC% - application name in lower case
%TASKNAME% - task name
%FILETYPE% - file type in hex (e.g. 0x123)

The source files are also renamed so that any file beginning with APPNAME_ will have the APPNAME_ replaced with the name of the application.
