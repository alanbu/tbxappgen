This is TbxAppGen generated application.

This creates an application that uses the tbx::doc namespace and classes derived from it to create a document handling information.

The application incorporates and iconbar that when clicked shows a new document. A file dropped on it will load the document as will double clicking on a file with the correct type in the filer.

It implements the SaveAs, Quit, DCS and FileInfo processing using the tbx::doc classes allowing just the document data and window to be coded without having to do all the plumbing.

It includes:
  !Boot a boot file that sets up the file type and other
  variables.
  !Run a file that runs the application.
  !Sprites the application sprite
  Messages a minimal messages file
  Res the toolbox resources file
  cc.main the c++ source for the main entry point
  h.%APPNAME%Doc, cc.%APPNAME%Doc - a class derived from tbx::doc::Document where you put the data structures for the document. At a minimum you need to finish the document_size, load and save members.
  h.%APPNAME%Wnd, cc.%APPNAME%Wnd - a class derived from tbx::doc::DocWindow which is used to show the contents fo the document and allow editing of it. Edit the constructor to show the initial document and set up listeners/gadget to do the editing.
  h.%APPNAME%FileType - a file with the documents file type. If you need to change the file type used, change this file and the !Boot file.

  Makefile a makefile to build the project

Things that need to be done
  Design you own sprite
  Update the Program Information dialogue
  Modify the Window resource to be suitable for your application.
  Add code to the %APPNAME%Doc and %APPNAME%Wnd class to do your processing including loading of the file.
  Replace the !Help file with your own content.
  Set the Wimpslot in the !Run file to a sensible value
